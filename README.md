spaCy is an open-source software library for advanced natural language processing, written in the programming languages Python and Cython. 

# An NLP pipeline in spaCy has 3 components:
- Tagger (POS Tagger)
- Parser ( Dependency Parser)
- NER (Named Entity Recognition)

- Our main agenda is to implement a custom sentiment model for capturing the sentiment of tweets using the specific portion of the text.

- Generating train dataset is the major challenge for NLP modeling problems. We have used Prodigy to create our own dataset for training the text dataset.
